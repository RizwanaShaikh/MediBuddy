1. This project analyzes insurance claims data from MediBuddy, a digital healthcare platform providing inpatient, outpatient, and corporate wellness benefits. The goal is to identify key factors impacting insurance costs and develop a predictive model for estimating insurance charges.

2. Dataset Description:

Dataset 1: Contains age and BMI details obtained from pre-policy health checkups.

Dataset 2: Includes personal details such as number of dependents, smoking status, and geographic location of policyholders.

3. Key Objectives & Analysis:

A. EDA & Business Insights:

----Analyze gender, age, BMI, smoking, dependents, and region to understand their impact on insurance claims.

----Identify trends and risk factors affecting policy costs.

B. Predictive Modeling:

----Build a Machine Learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to accurately predict insurance charges.

----Perform hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.

C. Business Recommendations:

----Implement risk-based pricing strategies (higher premiums for high-risk individuals).

----Introduce health-based discounts for policyholders with normal BMI.

----Customize policies based on age, smoking status, and dependents to optimize pricing and reduce claim risks.

4. Expected Business Impact:
A. Data-driven pricing models ensuring profitability.
B. Optimized premium structures based on customer risk profiles.
C. Improved policyholder satisfaction with personalized pricing and discounts.
